        <p>Web developers are at the forefront of the Internet age. The websites we browse, the gifts we order and the news we peruse online are all made possible by the web developers who design, build and implement Internet websites. They are heavily involved in website creation, from helping design aesthetic properties such as layout and color, to technical considerations such as how to design a website to handle a given amount of Internet traffic.</p>
